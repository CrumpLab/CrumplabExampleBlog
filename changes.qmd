This file will attempt to keep track of structural changes to this site to provide examples of modification options. See also the [quarto website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) for more help.

This blog was initialized as a quarto blog project using Rstudio, and then turned into a github template available here <https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog>.

Initial changes were making a new post in the posts folder.

## changes.qmd

This page is not a regular blog post, instead it has been added as a new page to the top level navigation of the website.

To add this page the file `changes.qmd` was created in the root director. Next, the `_quarto.yml` was modified to [add this page to the top-level navigation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html#top-navigation).

The original yml file had this text:

``` yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "quartoCourseBlog"
  navbar:
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/MattCrumpLab
format:
  html:
    theme: minty
    css: styles.css

editor: visual
```

I wanted this page to appear on the left side, so under the navbar section I added left, and a new entry for `changes.qmd`.

``` yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "quartoCourseBlog"
  navbar:
    left:
      - changes.qmd
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/MattCrumpLab
format:
  html:
    theme: minty
    css: styles.css

editor: visual
```

## Blog title

The template gives the default name "quartoCourseBlog". I changed this to "CrumpLabExampleBlog" in two files:

1.  `_quarto.yml` - changed the `title` field

From:

``` yaml
website:
  title: "quartoCourseBlog"
```

To:

``` yaml
website:
  title: "CrumpLabExampleBlog"
```

Notice, this changes the title in the top-level navigation, but does not change the larger bolded title in the header of the page.

2.  `index.qmd` - change title field in the top-level yaml.

From:

``` yaml
---
title: "quartoCourseBlog"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  image-placeholder: "images/logo.png"
  categories: true
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: true
---
```

To:

``` yaml
---
title: "CrumpLabExampleBlog"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  image-placeholder: "images/logo.png"
  categories: true
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: true
---
```

Now the title in the navigation is the same as the title in the header for the page.

## Remove title block

The large block of green space with the blog title is called the `title-block-banner`, and this is an option in the yaml for `index.qmd`. Setting the option to `false` removes the title block.

``` yaml
---
title: "CrumpLabExampleBlog"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  image-placeholder: "images/logo.png"
  categories: true
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: false
---
```

## Change default image

The `index.qmd` file in the root folder has a line:

``` yaml
image-placeholder: "images/logo.png"
```

I changed replaced the file in `images/logo.png` with a different file to change the image. I could have put a different image in that folder, and then changed the name in the yaml as well.

## Make sure github icon links to correct github repo

Change the href for the github entry to the url for your github repository.

``` yaml
website:
  title: "CrumpLabExampleBlog"
  navbar:
    left:
      - changes.qmd
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/CrumpLab/CrumplabExampleBlog
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com/MattCrumpLab
```
