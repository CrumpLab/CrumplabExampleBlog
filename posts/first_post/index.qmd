It is February 6th, 2023; and, this is an example quarto blog for students in my classes.

The purpose of this blog is to provide working examples of source code and other files showing how to implement various quarto and/or R functionality.

I expect this blog will mostly be for students in [PSYC 3470](https://crumplab.com/psyc3470/), but there will likely be additional blog posts for students in other classes or conducting research in the lab.

The source code for this repository can be viewed on github.

Many of the contributions to this blog will be new posts. However, many other changes are possible, including adding whole new pages. A quarto blog is a special case of a quarto website and can easily be expanded with any quarto website feature. My plan is to keep the expansions relatively simple, and to document changes that I make on the [changes](../../changes.qmd) page to show more working examples.
