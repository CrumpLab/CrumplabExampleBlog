IF the person is taller than the line, then they can go on the ride; ELSE (otherwise) the person can not go on the ride.\nIn other words, IF the situation is X, then do something; ELSE (if the situation is not X), then do something different.\nIF and ELSE statements let us specify the conditions when specific actions are taken. Generally, IF and ELSE statements are used inside loops (for, or while, or repeat loops), because at each step or iteration of the loop, we want to check something, and then do something.\nConsider this:\n\na <- 1 # define a to be a 1\n\nif (a == 1) {\n  print(a) # this is what happens if a==1\n} else {\n  print(\"A is not 1\") # this is what happens if a is not 1\n}\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\na <- 2 # define a to be a 1\nif (a == 1) {\n  print(a) # this is what happens if a==1\n} else {\n  print(rbinom(10,1,.5)) # this is what happens if a is not 1\n  1+1\n  print(\"hello world\")\n  rbinom(10,1,.5)\n}\n\n [1] 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0\n[1] \"hello world\"\n\n\n [1] 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\n\n\na <- 3.5\n\nif(a >= 4){\n  print(\"get to go on the cyclone\")\n}\n\nif(a < 4){\n  print(\"sorry\")\n}\n\n[1] \"sorry\"\n\n\nNormally we find IF and ELSE in a loop like this:\n\na <- c(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) # make a variable contain 1s and 0s\n# write a loop to check each element in the variable\n# and do different things depending on the element\n\nfor (i in a) {\n  \n  if (i == 1) {\n    print(\"I'm a 1\") # what to do when i is 1\n  } else {\n    print(\"I'm not a 1\") # what to do when i is not 1\n  }\n  \n}\n\n[1] \"I'm a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm not a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm a 1\"\n\n\nWe can have multiple conditions in our if statements. See the next section on loops for more info about using loops.\n\na <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1) # make a variable contain 1s and 0s\n# write a loop to check each element in the variable\n# and do different things depending on the element\nfor (i in a) {\n  if (i == 1) {\n    print(\"I'm a 1\") # what to do when i is 1\n  } else if (i == 2) {\n    print(\"I'm a 2\") # what to do when i is 2\n  } else if (i == 3) {\n    print(\"I'm a 3\") # what to do when i is 3\n  } else {\n    print(\"I'm not any of the above\") #what to do when none are true\n  }\n}\n\n[1] \"I'm a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm a 2\"\n[1] \"I'm a 3\"\n[1] \"I'm a 1\"\n[1] \"I'm a 2\"\n[1] \"I'm not any of the above\"\n[1] \"I'm a 1\""

The name of the iterator is placed on the left of in(can be assigned any name you want, does not need to be declared in advance). During the execution of the loop, the iterator takes on the values inside the vector which is placed on the right side of in. Specifically, the following is happening.\nLoop steps: 1. iterator <- vector[1] 2. iterator <- vector[2] 3. iterator <- vector[3] 4. etc.\nThe loop will automatically stop once it reaches the last item in the vector. The loop can be stopped before that using the break command.\n\n# Make a loop do something 5 times\n# i is the iterator\n# 1:5 creates a vector with 5 numbers in it, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n# the loop will run 5 times, because there are five things to assign to i\nfor(i in 1:5) {\n  print(\"hello\")\n}\n\n[1] \"hello\"\n[1] \"hello\"\n[1] \"hello\"\n[1] \"hello\"\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n\n\n# show the value of i each step of the loop\nfor(i in 1:5) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n# define the vector to loop over in advance\nx <- 1:5\nfor (i in x) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n# Reminder that i becomes the next value in the vector\n# your vector can have any order \nmy_sequence <- c(1, 5, 2, 3, 4)\nfor (i in my_sequence) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 5\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n# index vector does not need to be numbers\nmy_things <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\nfor (i in my_things) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] \"A\"\n[1] \"B\"\n[1] \"C\"\n[1] \"D\"\n\n\n\nBreaking a loop\nbreak stops a loop.

    "text": "jsPsych aims to provide a productive, helpful, and agile community that: * Welcomes new users and ideas * Seeks to improve the jsPsych library for all users * Works toward best scientific practices * Ensures that jsPsych remains as accessible as possible\nWe hope that this community will encourage collaboration between users/groups with different needs, interests, and skills.\njsPsych was created with the goal of making web-based behavioral experiments as easy as possible for those who do not have a background in web development or any other kind of computer programming. Thus, novice users are an essential part of this community. The involvement of beginner programmers is not only welcome, but critical for the continued success of the project.\nSimilarly, a core aim of the jsPsych project is to make web-based behavioral experiments accessible to anyone who wishes to utilize them. We can better achieve this goal with diverse voices guiding the project, and we value participation from those who bring different perspectives to our community. We actively encourage participation from those who come from historically underrepresented groups in software development and STEM.\n\n\n\nBe friendly and patient: Remember that you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary spoken or programming language, and that we don’t all have the same background knowledge and experience.\nBe helpful: Offer constructive feedback on others’ ideas and code.\nBe collaborative: Collaboration improves the efficiency and quality of our work. We aim to understand the needs of other users, and to work transparently with others to coordinate our efforts.\nBe considerate and respectful: There is no excuse for disrespectful behavior. When making comments in public spaces, we should consider the potential impact on the whole community. For instance, jokes/teasing may seem harmless among users who are familiar with one another, but this can be intimidating and off-putting for other community members.\nAsk for help and seek feedback: We’re all learning, and no one is expected to be perfect. Asking questions and seeking feedback early on can help us work efficiently and avoid bigger problems in the future.\nTake responsibility for your actions: We all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to improve our behavior.\nValue decisiveness, clarity, and consensus: We hope that jsPsych contributors can resolve disagreements constructively, using clear rationale for their perspective, and with humility. When they cannot, the project leader can offer clarity and direction.\n\n\n\n\nThe community’s core principles apply to all private and public spaces where the jsPsych project is officially managed, promoted, or discussed. Examples include all of the jsPsych-related GitHub repos (issues, commit messages, pull requests, etc.), the jsPsych Google Group, and anyone acting as a representative of the project, whether in person or online, including via social media and email. We expect this Code of Conduct to be honoured by everyone in the jsPsych community.\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage all participants in the jsPsych community to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel that innovation could improve the project. There is no need to wait for delegation or permission - leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action.\nAlthough we strive to make jsPsych as open and collaborative as possible, it’s important to have a project leader in order to ensure that jsPsych remains (1) as accessible as possible for all users, (2) stable and reliable, (3) easy to maintain, (4) internally consistent, etc.\nSuch leadership occasionally requires decisions that are in the best interest of the project but may not be understood by or beneficial to everyone. These decisions are important because they keep the project on track, and enable it to move forward faster than if we required complete consensus. Any major decisions taken by the project leader should be mindful of the challenges they may present for others. We expect the project leader to communicate major decisions/changes early on, and to provide their reasoning.\n\n\nWe invite anyone to contribute to any aspect of the project. You can find more information about contributing here: https://www.jspsych.org/latest/developers/contributing/\nBecause changes to the jsPsych library can have a huge potential for impact on all users, any proposed changes to the library have to be considered very carefully. For this reason, it is always a good idea to check with the project leader about whether your proposed contribution would likely be merged into the jsPsych library. Keep in mind that, even if your work isn’t suitable for merging into the jsPsych library, you can still use it in your own projects and share it publicly with others, e.g. via a separate GitHub repository.\nContributors are acknowledged in the contributors.md file in the jsPsych GitHub repo, and in the notes for each release. If you feel that your contribution has been overlooked, please contact Josh de Leeuw (josh.deleeuw@gmail.com). We also encourage opening a pull request to modify the contributors.md file.\n\n\n\nWe expect jsPsych users and developers to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or other projects they are involved in, and to abstain or delegate decisions that may be seen to be self-interested. We expect that everyone who participates in the jsPsych community does so with the goal of improving the library for all of its users.\n\n\n\n\nIn the event that a Code of Conduct issue cannot be resolved among users, please feel free to report your concerns to Josh de Leeuw (josh.deleeuw@gmail.com). If Josh de Leeuw is involved in the issue, you can report it to Becky Gilbert instead (beckyannegilbert@gmail.com). In your report, please include as much information as possible about what occurred, including any relevant links/attachments.\nAll reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.\nThis code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a welcoming, productive, and collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.\n\n\n\nThis document was based on, or inspired by, the following Codes of Conduct: * Ubuntu https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct * Microsoft https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/ * Contributor Covenant https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct"

In this case, each row would contain one measurement, and each column would code the conditions associated with the measurement.\nAn example of wide vs. long data. In this example, the long-data is in tidy format.

    "text": "This is a template for using quarto to create a course blog. A course blog can be used in many ways to engage with course content. For example, you could use the blog to post assignments, or to dive more deeply into course material that interests you. By the end of the course, your blog can serve as a portfolio of ways that you engaged in the material. By learning how to use quarto for your blog, you will also be learning new skills for creating and sharing reproducible documents that could be useful to you in the future.\nThe purpose of this page is to provide tips and pointers about blogging with quarto. Quarto is simple enough for creating a basic course blog. However, it is also very deep and can be used to create all sorts of documents, from website, to slide decks, and books.\n\n\nMany questions about quarto can be answered from the quarto documentation located at: https://quarto.org.\nIf you are looking for something specific and don’t know where to find it on the website, use the search tool in the top right corner.\n\n\n\n\nTo use this template you will need a Github.com account, and access to R and Rstudio.\nYou can get access by creating a Github.com account, and downloading the necessary open-source software to your machine.\nIt is also possible to use Rstudio in your web-browser, which does not require downloading any software. There are two sets of instructions, one for the downloading approach, and the other for using Rstudio cloud. Scroll to the bottom for instructions on using Rstudio cloud.\n\n\n\nIn order to use this template you will need to install some free open-source software on your computer.\n\nSign up for a free account at https://github.com. This a website for sharing open-source software, but it can also be used to serve your blog as a website for free.\nDownload Github Desktop and install it on your machine. This should install the version control software git on your system, and you can use Github Desktop to easily push your blog from your local computer so that it can be viewed on Github.com.\nDownload R and install it on your machine. R is a programming language capable of many things, and it needs to be on your machine before you can run R Studio.\nDownload R Studio Desktop and install it on your machine. R Studio is called an “IDE” or integrated development environment, that you can use to write your blog with quarto.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have the software installed, the next step is to create a quarto blog project in R studio. The collection of files in this template is a pre-made quarto blog project that you can modify for your own purposes. You can also make one yourself in Rstudio.\nAssuming you have downloaded this template, and you have installed the above software, then you need to open quartoCourseBlog.Rproj.\n\n\n\n\nTo find out if everything is working, try rendering the blog. Go to the “Build” Tab and press “Render Website”.\n\nAfter the rendering is complete, you should be able to view your blog. It might show up in the viewer pane like this:\n\nAnd if you press the ‘window-with-an-arrow’ button, you can view the website in your default browser. Quarto websites automatically adjust for the size of the window, so it may appear differently in the viewer pane versus the browser.\n\n\n\nAll of the blog posts are located in the posts folder.\n\nTo make a new post, copy an existing post and then modify it. For example, my posts folder currently contains one post, and it is inside the my_first_post folder.\n\nI can copy the folder and make a new one with the same contents from the Rstudio gear-box menu:\n\nI made a folder for a second post called Example_assignment.\n\nThese are the two files inside the folder. The .qmd file is a plain text file where you will write the blog post. This folder can also be used to store other assets you might put in the post, such as pictures.\n\n\n\nTo write a new post, open the .qmd file, edit the text, and then re-render the website. This is what the text in the .qmd file looked like when I copied it.\n\nThe text at the top between the “---” is called YAML, and provides meta-data for your document. This is where you can change the title, date, name, and add keywords if you want.\nThe rest of the document is for the main body of the post. For example, I changed the text to read:\n\n\n\n\n\nRender the website from the build tab again to see your new post.\n\n\n\nTo share your blog online you will have to publish it on a server that can be accessed by other people on the internet. There are multiple ways to do this step, and I recommend using Github pages. You can view more in-depth instructions from quarto here https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html.\nHere are the steps:\n\nOpen Github Desktop\nGo to preferences and sign in to your Github.com account\n“Add” your blog project folder to Github Desktop\nThere should be an option for a commit message, write a note in there like “first commit”.\nPublish to github.com and uncheck private repository so that other people will be able to see your repository.\nYou should now be able to see your new repository in your github.com profile, which means you should be able to see a copy of your blog files in the repository.\nActivate Github pages for your repository (under repository settings), and serve the page from the “docs” folder.\nAccess the blog from the url generated by the github pages settings page.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you make changes to your blog project that you want to share online follow these steps:\n\nMake changes to your blog, like writing a new post, or editing an old one.\nRender the website in R-studio. What you see here should be what you will see later on Github.com\nOpen Github Desktop and Commit your changes, by writing brief commit title, and pressing commit.\nThen, use Github Desktop to Push your changes to github.com.\nWait half a minute or so, and you should see your new content appear on the website.\n\n\n\n\nI am planning to add a video overview of these steps soon. In the meantime, these instructions may be enough to get started with R studio cloud and github.com.\n\nSign up for a free account with posit cloud here https://posit.cloud/plans/free\nSign up for a free https://github.com account.\nLog in to Github, and search for this repository https://github.com/CrumpLab/quartoCourseBlog.\n\n\nClick the green “Use this template” Button\nThis will make a copy of the template in your github account, it will show up as one of your repositories\nGive your new repository a name\n\n\nActivate Github pages for your repository (under repository settings), and serve the page from the “docs” folder. You should now be able to view the blog from the url given by github pages.\nLog into Posit Cloud\nCreate a New Project, choose “New Project from Git Repository”\n\n\nenter the URL to the github repository you just made\n\n\nLoad the project, and edit/modify the files (see above for examples of creating new posts etc.)\nTo send your changed files back to github.com you need to do a few steps\n\n\nFrom the Git tab: stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes using the green up arrow.\nYou will also need to authenticate your git credentials, and allow Rstudio cloud to update your github repository\nIn the terminal run these two lines, but replace with your name and email\n\n\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n\nWhen you “push” your changes back to Github using the green up arrow, you will be asked to enter a username and password. You can enter the username for your Github.com account, but your password won’t work. You need to set up a personal access token.\nGo to your github.com profile > settings page. Scroll down, click on “<> Developer Settings”, on the left\nClick on personal access tokens, generate a new token, give it repo access. Save the text somewhere and use it as your github password when pushing from RStudio.\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to work on your blog in Rstudio Cloud, and push your changes to have them updated on github.com, which serves your blog online.\n\n\n\n\nSee this growing list of quarto resources for much, much more:\nhttps://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto"
